# Map
Collection of scripts to create custom maps out of map screenshots

## How does it work?
I'm using [Mapy.cz](https://mapy.cz) as a source of screenshots which are
then stitched together using [PanoTools](https://wiki.panotools.org/Main_Page).

### Mapy.cz
As far as I know [Mapy.cz](https://mapy.cz) have only a couple
of URL parameters:
- l = 0/1 (open sidebar)
- lgnd = anything? (show legend in sidebar - open or closed)
- x = longitude
- y = latitude
- z = 2 - 19 (zoom level)
